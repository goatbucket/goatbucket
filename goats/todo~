NEEDS FIXING

why can I log in when already logged in?

home page/index should be an informative landing page with register/log in buttons.
if you're logged in, it should redirect you to /username, which will have the newsfeed (by default?)

on event submission - goat selector should be an autocomplete text box somehow
and date should be auto set to now

TO DO
-somehow consolidate all of the new_x views?
-add a little notification when new_x is added


DESIGN QUESTIONS
can I view other users pages? do I have to be logged in to do so?

if I sell goats to another user, there is a way to transfer the animal's file over to them, ether for them to print out or add to their herd on the website.

birthevent and health event should be subclasses of event, no? drop down list of type: birth, health, milk record, lactation, transaction, other will change the fields of form (enter goat info, enter # of milk, enter length of lactation, etc)

settings to change: average lactation length, what events are shown in feed, what info is public (?)
=======
